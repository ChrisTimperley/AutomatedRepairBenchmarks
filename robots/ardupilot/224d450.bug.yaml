  Rover: fixed a bug going into guided and rover still moving.
  When the rover goes into guided mode it sets the current location as
  the guided point to goto.  If the rover is stationary when this
  happens no problem.  If however the rover is still rolling (say going
  from AUTO to GUIDED) then the rover would go past its guided position
  and get confused and begin to circle it.  This change resolves that issue.
