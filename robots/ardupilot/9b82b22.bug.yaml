   AP_NavEKF2: Fix plane in-flight yaw reset

   The copter method was being used for plane and the plane method was not being run due to the change in flight status not being detected.
   The plane reset method did not trigger if the EKF had already dragged the velocity states along with the GPS or could align to an incorrect heading.
   The method has been reworked so that it resets to the GPS course, but only if there are inconsistent angles and large innovations.
   To stop a failed magnetometer causing a loss of yaw reference later in flight, if all available sensors have been tried in flight and timed out, then no further magnetometer data will be used
