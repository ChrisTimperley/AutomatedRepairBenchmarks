  Rover: fixed bug when reverse throttle would increase speed in AUTO.

  Fixed bug #840.

  If a Rover was in AUTO and the user moved the throttle stick into
  reverse past 50% the rover would increase.  Basically the throttle
  nudge behaviour was the same regardless of whether you moved the
  throttle forward or backward.
