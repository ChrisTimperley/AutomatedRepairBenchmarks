    MFH: 45a6f8d for 5.4.
    
    - Further fix for bug #60455 (stream_get_line misbehaves if EOF is not detected
      together with the last read).
    - Fixed bug #60817 (stream_get_line() reads from stream even when there is
      already sufficient data buffered). stream_get_line() now behaves more like
      fgets(), as is documented.
