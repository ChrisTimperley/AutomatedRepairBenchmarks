    - Make fclose() actually close stream, even when the resource refcount is > 1.
      This reverts the fix for bug #24557.
    - Make php_stream_free delete the stream from the resources list, not merely
      decrease its refcount, as a single call to zend_list_delete does.
    #Not worth the risk merging to 5.3. While change #2 may prevent some segfaults,
    #a quick and dirty survey to the codebase only showed calls to php_stream_close
    #or php_stream_free on streams allocated in the same function, which would have
    #refcount == 1. May be reconsidered.
