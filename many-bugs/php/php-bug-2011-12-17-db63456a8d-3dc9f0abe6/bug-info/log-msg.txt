    Fixed inconsistent and broken handling of private properties in traits.
    # The handling of private properties in classes is now consistent with private properties in traits.
    # Perviously, privates could cause strict warnings, are were not properly merged into the class when
    # the parent class had a private property of the same name. Now, we introduce it without notice,
    # since it is a new and independent property, just like in normal classes.
    # This problem was diagnosed while working on Bug #60536.
