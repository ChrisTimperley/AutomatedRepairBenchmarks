# BugZoo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/squaresLab/BugZoo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/squaresLab/BugZoo)

BugZoo is a decentralised platform for distributing,
reproducing, and interacting with historical software bugs.
BugZoo connects existing datasets and tools to developers and
researchers, and provides a controlled environment for conducting experiments.
To ensure reproducibility, extensibility, and usability, BugZoo
uses Docker containers to package, deliver, and interact with bugs and
tools.

Using BugZoo to conduct experiments has the following advantages:
