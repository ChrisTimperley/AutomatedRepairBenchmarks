# BugZoo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/squaresLab/BugZoo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/squaresLab/BugZoo)

BugZoo is a decentralised platform for distributing,
reproducing, and interacting with historical software bugs. BugZoo is designed
to support both software engineering researchers as well as developers of tools
for program testing, analysis and repair.

How it works.

Using BugZoo to conduct experiments has the following advantages:

## Features

* A simple but powerful command-line interface for building, downloading and
  interacting with historical bugs.
* A Python interface for complex, structured interactions with historical
  bugs: execute specific tests, compute line coverage, apply patches, compile
  with certain flags, and more.
* A powerful underlying RESTful API that can be used to add BugZoo bindings to your
  own favourite language.
* Download prebuilt software snapshots.
* A decentralised architecture that lets you share your tools and datasets of
  historical bugs on the BugZoo platform without giving up ownership or control.
* Provides reproducibility, via the use of containers, without sacrificing
  performance.
* Add BugZoo support to your dataset or tool by adding a `.bugzoo.yml` file.

## Installation

We recommend using [pipenv](http://pipenv.org/) to install BugZoo, although you
may use `pip` instead:

```
$ pipenv install bugzoo
```

## Getting Started

Use ManyBugs and GenProg as an example.

## Known Sources

Below is a list of sources that are known to provide datasets or tools that
are compatible with the BugZoo platform.

* [ManyBugs](https://github.com/squaresLab/ManyBugs)
* [GenProg](https://github.com/squaresLab/genprog-code)

To add one of these sources, simply execute the following from the command line:

```
$ bugzoo source add manybugs https://github.com/squaresLab/ManyBugs
$ bugzoo source add genprog https://github.com/squaresLab/genprog-code
```
