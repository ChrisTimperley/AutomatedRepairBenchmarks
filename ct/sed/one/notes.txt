It turns out my initially seeded bug couldn't be fixed, since the case labels
are attached to the first statement for each case.

* it's possible to get around this by adding NOOPs as the first statement after
  a case label
* still... there are over 12,000 edits within the window of this statement. The
  odds of hitting it on any run are very slim.
