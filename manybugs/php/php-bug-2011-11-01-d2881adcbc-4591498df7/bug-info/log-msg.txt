    Fixed Bug #60153 (Interface method prototypes not enforced when implementd via traits.)
    # Moved the freeing of overriden functions to a point after the check.
    # The new check comes after the normal inheritance check to give the first check
    # the opportunity to abort with a more detailed error.
    # Also fixed a small type in an unrelated test.
