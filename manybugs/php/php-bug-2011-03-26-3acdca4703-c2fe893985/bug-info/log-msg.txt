    - Fixed bug #54384: Several SPL classes crash when parent constructor is
      not called.
    #Merge to 5.3 pending (slight BC break on AppendIterator, as it's no
    #longer possible to defer the call to the parent constructor until
    #after the constructor is performed).
    #Bugs fixed in an atypical way for SPL. The parent constructor call
    #check is performed at construction time by using a wrapper constructor
    #instead of a check on the beginning of each instance method.
    #Perhaps this should be uniformized in trunk; this method was mainly
    #applied only to the ones crashing, except a few iterators (at least
    #AppendIterator and RecursiveIteratorIterator).
