    - PHP_STREAM_OPTION_WRITE_BUFFER no longer disables the read buffer of a plain
      stream when 0 is given as the value.
    - PHP_STREAM_OPTION_WRITE_BUFFER no longer changes the chunk size in socket
      streams.
    - Added stream_set_chunk_size() function.
    - Some signedness fixes.
    - Test for commit r308474, now that it's possible to actually test it.
