    Fix bug #60768  Output buffer not discarded
    
     in php_output_handler_op():
      * if appending to buffer succeeds, just return HANDLER_NO_DATA
        and do nothing else
      * if a zero sized string or true is returned from the handler
        function, reset the context as well as the handler's buffer
