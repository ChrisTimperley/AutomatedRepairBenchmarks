    - Changed port validation introduced in commit #308035 to consider
      negative ports and ports > 65535 as invalid.
      The tests that fail due to #308035 in the standard ext were not
      fixed. If the behavior in those tests turns out to be the
      desirable one, both this commit and #308035 ought to be reverted
      or at least adapted.
