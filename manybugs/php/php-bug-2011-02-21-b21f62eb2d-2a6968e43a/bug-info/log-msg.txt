    - Fixed bug #54055 (buffer overrun with high values for precision ini
      setting).
    #This fix (for g/G/k/H modes) is done at a different level than that for the
    #modes e/E/f/F, at a bit higher level and therefore with less coverage. I
    #chose this because it addresses the problem where it is -- the calling function
    #that passes a buffer too small to php_gcvt.
