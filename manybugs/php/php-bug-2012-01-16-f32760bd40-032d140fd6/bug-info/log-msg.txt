    Improved traits implementation. Now to support __CLASS__ constant in traits php doesn't have to copy the complete compiled method, but can reuse the same code. The resolution of __CLASS__ constants in methods defined in traits are delayed till run-time. This approach also made possible to use __CLASS__ constant as default value for traits properties and method arguments.
