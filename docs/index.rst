To use BugZoo, you will need Python >= 3.5 installed, along with Docker; we
also suggest that you install `pipenv` to simplify installation and to isolate
your BugZoo installation from any other Python packages on your system.

After ensuring that the requirements above are installed on your machine, you
may install BugZoo using [pipenv](http://pipenv.org/) (preferred) or `pip3`:

```
$ pipenv install bugzoo
