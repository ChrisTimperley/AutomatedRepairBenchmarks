File Format
===========

In this section, we describe the file format of BugZoo manifest files, which
are used by sources to describe snapshots (i.e., historical, and possibly
defective, software versions), datasets of snapshots (e.g., ManyBugs and
IntroClass), and plugins.

Manifest files must be written in YAML, and should be named with a
:code:`.bugzoo.yml` suffix (e.g., :code:`my-manifest.bugzoo.yml`).
