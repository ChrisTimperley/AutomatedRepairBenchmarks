    gzip: fix a data-loss bug when decompressing with --suffix=''
    
    * gzip.c (main): Disallow an empty --suffix=S also with -d.
    Otherwise, "gzip -d -S '' F.gz" would ask if it's ok to remove the
    existing file, "F.gz";  if you reply "yes", you'd lose all of that data.
    Use of an empty suffix was already rejected in compression mode.
    * gzip.1 (--suffix (-S)): Do not recommend to use "gunzip -S '' *".
    Describe how the suffix is used when decompressing, too.
    * NEWS (Bug fixes): mention the fix.
    Reported by Ripduman Sohan.
